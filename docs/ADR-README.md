# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the NFL meta-model project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR documents important architectural decisions made during the project lifecycle, including:
- Context: What forces are at play (technical, business, team, etc.)
- Decision: What we decided to do
- Consequences: What becomes easier or harder as a result

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-YYYYMMDD-short-title

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Deciders:** List of people involved

## Context

What is the issue we're trying to address? What are the constraints and requirements?

## Decision

What did we decide to do?

## Consequences

### Positive
- What becomes easier or better

### Negative
- What becomes harder or worse

### Neutral
- Side effects that are neither clearly positive nor negative

## Alternatives Considered

What other options did we evaluate and why were they rejected?

## Next Steps

What follow-up actions are needed?
```
